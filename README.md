# EaglercraftX 1.8 🎮

This repository contains the offline, single-file version of EaglercraftX 1.8 (update 53). Eaglercraft is a browser-based version of Minecraft, allowing you to play the game directly in your web browser without needing a traditional installation. 🌐

## How to Play 🚀

Playing Eaglercraft from this repository is a simple process. The main benefit of using a local HTML file is that it might bypass standard web filters, as the game runs locally within your browser rather than connecting to a blocked website.

### 1. Download the file 📥

You need to download the file to your computer first:

*   Navigate to the main page of this GitHub repository.
*   Click on the file named **`EaglercraftX_1.8_u53_Offline_Signed.html`**.
*   On the next page, click the **"Download raw file"** button (or right-click the "Raw" button and select "Save link as...").
*   Save the file to a location you can easily find, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

### 2. Transfer the file (for school Chromebooks) 🔄

If the GitHub website or the download itself is blocked on your school Chromebook, you may need to use a personal device to download the file first, and then transfer it using Google Drive:

*   **Download** the file on a personal device.
*   **Upload** the downloaded `.html` file to your personal Google Drive account.
*   **Log in** to your Google account on your school Chromebook.
*   **Access** the file in Google Drive or download it from Drive to your Chromebook's local "Files" app.

### 3. Open in your browser 🖥️

Once the file is on your Chromebook (in the "Downloads" folder via the Files app):

*   **Locate** the `EaglercraftX_1.8_u53_Offline_Signed.html` file.
*   **Double-click** the file.

Your default web browser will automatically open the file, and the game will start loading.

### 4. Start playing! 🎉

The game should now be running in your browser. You can play single-player worlds offline or join compatible Eaglercraft servers.

Enjoy your game! ✨
